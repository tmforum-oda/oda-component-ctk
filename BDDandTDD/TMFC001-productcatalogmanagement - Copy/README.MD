Using BDD to define Component Features using Scenarios
------------------------------------------------------

This repository is experimenting using Behavior-driven development (BDD) to document the functionality of an ODA component. 

Using the Cucumber.js (https://cucumber.io/) implementation of BDD, you describe the features of a component in a feature file using the Gherkin language (https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).

We are basing the example feature on the [IG1228 use-case UC002 Browse B2C Catalogue](https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/display/PUB/Use+Case+UC002%3A+Browse+B2C+catalogue+and+check+Fiber+technical+eligibility+v1). The features file in the Gherkin language looks like:


 ![Feature](images/feature.png)


This describes a business friendly structure with the feature description and some scenarios where you can test that feature in the *When* *Then* format.



A list of features described in this way would be included in the *Golden Component* definition for each functional component.


Generating automated tests from features
----------------------------------------

Assuming you have created the feature in a file called `./features/IG1228-UC002-Browse-B2C-Catalogue.feature` you can run the test by typing:

```
./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js ./features/IG1228-UC002-Browse-B2C-Catalogue.feature
```
You should see some warnings, because we havenâ€™t told Cucumber.js how each step is actually implemented yet.The warnings are designed to help you develop the actual tests. For example, you will see something like:

```
Warnings:

1) Scenario: Load the product categories # features\IG1228-UC002-Browse-B2C-Catalogue.feature:3
   ? When we request the products categories
       Undefined. Implement with the following snippet:


         When('we request the products categories', function () {
           // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
           return 'pending';
         });

   ? Then we should receive list of categories
       | category name            | description                       |
       | Internet line of product | Fiber and ADSL broadband products |
       | Mobile line of product   | Mobile phones and packages        |
       | IoT line of product      | IoT devices and solutions         |
       Undefined. Implement with the following snippet:

         Then('we should receive list of categories', function (dataTable) {
           // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
           return 'pending';
         });
```


If you copy the code snippets into a file `./features/steps/IG1228-UC002-Steps.v1.js' and then fill in the actual test details, then you will see the tests start to succeed (or at least different warning messages!).

Running the BDD scripts
-----------------------

type:
```
npm start
```
